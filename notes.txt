Gensim    LDA



Evaluation:
Calculate relative to other values

Multiple SVMs for every features vector:
- Early fusion: Concatenate vectors
- Late fusion: Aggregate results from SVMs:
	Borda count (add rankings to eachtother) - use when a decent distribution
	Average between ranks - Use if there is a clear 'winner'

Experiment with different models, evaluations, different weights between SVM rankings
