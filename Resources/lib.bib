abstract = {Online social media are growing very rapidly in recent years, such as Twitter. Even the interaction and communication in the social media can reflect on the events of the real world. This causes the value of the information increasing significantly. However, the huge amount of the information requires a method of automatically detecting topics, one of which is the K-means Clustering. Moreover, the large dimensions of data become obstacles. So, we used singular value decomposition (SVD) to reduce the dimension of the data prior to the learning process using the K-means Clustering. The accuracy of the combination of SVD and K-means Clustering methods showed comparative results, while the computation time required is likely to be faster than the method of K-means Clustering without any reduction in advance.},

While not all online newspapers use such images to the same extent as the smh online, close-up thumbnails of faces are commonplace on online newspaper home pages in general. This paper examines the use of these {\textquotedblleft}thumbnail faces{\textquotedblright} on the smh online home page. Over four years (and across four page-design periods), these images were used more frequently, despite the fact that they function in a very different way to traditional hard-news images. Thumbnail faces cannot {\textquotedblleft}tell stories{\textquotedblright}, nor {\textquotedblleft}provide evidence{\textquotedblright}, but they play an important interpersonal role in individual news stories, collectively on the home page, and over time in the discursive relationship between the smh online and its readership.},

Normally sleep inertia lasts <5 min and has no serious impact on conducting routine jobs. This preliminary study examined whether there are best and worst times to wake up stemming from circadian effects on sleep inertia. Since the process of falling asleep is strongly influenced by circadian time, the reverse process of awakening could be similarly affected. A group of nine subjects stayed awake for a 64-h continuous work period, except for 20-min sleep periods (naps) every 6 h. Another group of 10 subjects stayed awake for 64 h without any sleep. The differences between these two groups in performance degradation are expected to show sleep inertia on the background of sleep deprivation. Sleep inertia was measured with Baddeley's logical reasoning task, which started within 1 min of awakening and lasted for 5 min. There appeared to be no specific circadian time when sleep ine...},

Fundamental distinctions between tacit and explicit knowledge and between know- how, know-why, know-what and know-who are related to distinctions between public/private and local/global knowledge. It is argued that the idea of the economy as being knowledge based in its current stage is misleading and that it is more enlightening to assume that we have moved into a learning economy where interactive learning is a key to economic performance of firms, regions and nations. This is one reason why a narrow economics perspective is insufficient. The most serious weakness of standard economics is that it abstracts from the fact that agents are more or less competent and that learning processes enhancing competence are fundamental for the economic performance of organisations and regions. When it comes to understand industrial dynamics in the learning economy it is necessary to bring in other disciplines than economics in the analysis.},

We model events using a variety of complementary semantic attribute features developed in a semantic concept space. Our contribution is to systematically demonstrate the advantages of this concept-based event representation (CBER) in applications of video event classification and understanding. Specifically, CBER has better generalization capability, which enables to recognize events with a few training examples. In addition, CBER makes it possible to recognize a novel event without training examples (i.e., zero-shot learning). We further show our proposed enhanced event model can further improve the zero-shot learning. Furthermore, CBER provides a straightforward way for event recounting/understanding. We use the TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection (MED11) open source event definitions and datasets as our test bed and show results on over 1400 hours of videos.},

abstract = {This study integrates cognitive and affective attitudes as the primary factors of influence to formulate a Ubiquitous Computing Acceptance Model (UCAM), which is intended to predict whether potential users will accept ubiquitous computing (u{\textendash}computing). The goal of this study was to empirically assess the UCAM by identifying the factors that contribute to user attitudes and intentions in u{\textendash}computing environments. This study is one of the first to empirically evaluate the relationships among trust, security, privacy, usefulness, ease of use and behavioural intention in the ubiquitous city context.},

abstract = {When explaining the failure of information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D) projects, researchers often turn to differences between how designers perceive and users experience the context of technology use. According to these explanations, ICT4D projects fail because designers take an uninformed stance toward context. The ICT4D literature offers four approaches for how designers might better design technology for the context of use. In all four approaches, the target of action is typically the technology itself, not the context. Despite increasing use of these four approaches, projects still fail because of persistent differences between designers{\textquoteright} perceptions and users{\textquoteright} experience. These differences appear inevitable because ICT4D projects address problems nested in complex systems whose interaction is difficult for designers to understand and predict. Yet, some projects do succeed. We show that success occurred in a Brazilian banking project because users took context-oriented, not technology-oriented, actions to better fit the technology with the context. Based on our case study, we develop propositions that integrate and expand existing theories of ICT4D project success.},

abstract = {Although sliding window-based approaches have been quite successful in detecting objects in images, it is not a trivial problem to extend them to detecting events in videos. We propose to search for spatiotemporal paths for video event detection. This new formulation can accurately detect and locate video events in cluttered and crowded scenes, and is robust to camera motions. It can also well handle the scale, shape, and intraclass variations of the event. Compared to event detection using spatiotemporal sliding windows, the spatiotemporal paths correspond to the event trajectories in the video space, thus can better handle events composed by moving objects. We prove that the proposed search algorithm can achieve the global optimal solution with the lowest complexity. Experiments are conducted on realistic video data sets with different event detection tasks, such as anomaly event detection, walking person detection, and running detection. Our proposed method is compatible with different types of video features or object detectors and robust to false and missed local detections. It significantly improves the overall detection and localization accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {While low-level image features have proven to be effective representations for visual recognition tasks such as object recognition and scene classification, they are inadequate to capture complex semantic meaning required to solve high-level visual tasks such as multimedia event detection and recognition. Recognition or retrieval of events and activities can be improved if specific discriminative objects are detected in a video sequence. In this paper, we propose an image representation, called Detection Bank, based on the detection images from a large number of windowed object detectors where an image is represented by different statistics derived from these detections. This representation is extended to video by aggregating the key frame level image representations through mean and max pooling. We empirically show that it captures complementary information to state-of-the-art representations such as Spatial Pyramid Matching and Object Bank. These descriptors combined with our Detection Bank representation significantly outperforms any of the representations alone on TRECVID MED 2011 data.},

Fifty-seven design variables and 10 underlying clusters that conceptualise the structure of user webpage judgement are identified through content analysis on literature and structured interviews, balanced incomplete block user survey administration and cluster analysis. Five clusters are selected to conduct three experiments that quantify the change in user aesthetic preference, perceived ease of interaction and interaction speed as a function of loading speed, image colour, image size, font size, link style, and column width. Results show that user performance alone is not a good indicator of aesthetic judgement and overall effectiveness of a webpage.

It requires relatively expensive equipment, such as high-speed complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors and customized optics. In this paper, we demonstrate how the usage of a simple personal computer (PC) mouse as an optical system composed of a low-power laser and a CMOS circuitry on the same integrated circuit package, can be used to monitor heartbeat from the wrist. The method is based on modifying the mouse optical system in such a way that it will recognize temporal change in skin{\textquoteright}s vibration profile, generated due to the heart pulses, as mouse movement. The tests that were carried out show a very good correlation between the heartbeat rate measured from human skin and the reference values taken manually.},

abstract = {A new type of push-pull amplifier system, especially designed to record accurately the large slow potentials, was used to study the potential patterns of sleep. Five states of sleep characterized by marked differences in potential could be recognized. They are A, alpha; B, low voltage; C, spindle; D, spindle and random; E, random; in order of appearance and in order of resistance to change by disturbances. It was discovered that movements might occur without a change of state and a change of state without movement, but frequently movement was immediately followed by a change of state upward, occasionally downward, and occasionally a movement occurred just after a change of state. During sleep there was a continual shift in states upward and downward, sometimes associated with recognized stimuli, sometimes without any external stimulus but probably as a result of internal stimuli. Stimuli shift the level upward, sometimes skipping one or two states but not necessarily awakening the sleeper. In two instances dreams occurred in the B state.

Firstly, rush videos are hierarchically modeled using the formal language technique. Secondly, shot detections are applied to introduce a new concept of V-unit for structuring videos in line with the hierarchical model, and thus junk frames within the model are effectively removed. Thirdly, adaptive clustering is employed to group shots into clusters to determine retakes for redundancy removal. Finally, each most representative shot selected from every cluster is ranked according to its length and sum of activity level for summarization. Competitive results have been achieved to prove the effectiveness and efficiency of our techniques, which are fully implemented in the compressed domain. Our work does not require high-level semantics such as object detection and speech/audio analysis which provides a more flexible and general solution for this topic.},

abstract = {We propose semantic model vectors, an intermediate level semantic representation, as a basis for modeling and detecting complex events in unconstrained real-world videos, such as those from YouTube. The semantic model vectors are extracted using a set of discriminative semantic classifiers, each being an ensemble of SVM models trained from thousands of labeled web images, for a total of 280 generic concepts. Our study reveals that the proposed semantic model vectors representation outperforms-and is complementary to-other low-level visual descriptors for video event modeling. We hence present an end-to-end video event detection system, which combines semantic model vectors with other static or dynamic visual descriptors, extracted at the frame, segment, or full clip level. We perform a comprehensive empirical study on the 2010 TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection task (http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/med10.cfm), which validates the semantic model vectors representation not only as the best individual descriptor, outperforming state-of-the-art global and local static features as well as spatio-temporal HOG and HOF descriptors, but also as the most compact. We also study early and late feature fusion across the various approaches, leading to a 15% performance boost and an overall system performance of 0.46 mean average precision. In order to promote further research in this direction, we made our semantic model vectors for the TRECVID MED 2010 set publicly available for the community to use (http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/{\textasciitilde}mmerler/SMV.html).},

The results demonstrate that moving displays of happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, anger, and disgust were recognized more accurately than static displays of the white spots at the apex of the expressions. This indicates that facial motion, in the absence of information about the shape and position of facial features, is informative about these basic emotions. Normally illuminated dynamic displays of these expressions, however, were recognized more accurately than displays of moving spots. The relative effectiveness of upper and lower facial areas for the recognition of the 6 emotions was also investigated using normally illuminated and spots-only displays. In both instances, the results indicate that different facial regions are more informative for different emotions. (20 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {With the growing popularity of short-form video sharing platforms such as {Instagram} and {Vine}, there has been an increasing need for techniques that automatically extract highlights from video. Whereas prior works have approached this problem with heuristic rules or supervised learning, we present an unsupervised learning approach that takes advantage of the abundance of user-edited videos on social media websites such as YouTube. Based on the idea that the most significant sub-events within a video class are commonly present among edited videos while less interesting ones appear less frequently, we identify the significant sub-events via a robust recurrent auto-encoder trained on a collection of user-edited videos queried for each particular class of interest. The auto-encoder is trained using a proposed shrinking exponential loss function that makes it robust to noise in the web-crawled training data, and is configured with bidirectional long short term memory (LSTM){\textasciitilde}{LSTM:97} cells to better model the temporal structure of highlight segments. Different from supervised techniques, our method can infer highlights using only a set of downloaded edited videos, without also needing their pre-edited counterparts which are rarely available online. Extensive experiments indicate the promise of our proposed solution in this challenging unsupervised settin},

The authors examine the effects of olfactory cues that are used as a novelty, as opposed to a product sample, on consumer attitudes. The results show that the addition of a more congruent scratch-and-sniff panel to an advertisement improves neither attitude toward the ad nor attitude toward the brand. Further, the addition of a poorer-fitting scent actually lowers attitudes among individuals who are more motivated to process. Those results appear to be a function of the mood evoked by the scented advertisement and of the scent's perceived pleasantness in the advertising context.},

abstract = {In general, popular films and screenplays follow a well defined storytelling paradigm that comprises three essential segments or acts: exposition (act I), conflict (act II) and resolution (act III). Deconstructing a movie into its narrative units can enrich semantic understanding of movies, and help in movie summarization, navigation and detection of the key events. A multimodal framework for detecting such three act narrative structure is developed in this paper. Various low-level features are designed and extracted from video, audio and text channels of a movie so as to capture the pace and excitement of the movie's narrative. Information from the three modalities is combined to compute a continuous dynamic measure of the movie's narrative flow, referred to as the story intensity of the movie in this paper. Guided by the knowledge of film grammar, the act boundaries are detected, and compared against annotations collected from human experts. Promising results are demonstrated for nine full-length Hollywood feature films of various genres.},

abstract = {Local spatiotemporal features or interest points provide compact but descriptive representations for efficient video analysis and motion recognition. Current local feature extraction approaches involve either local filtering or entropy computation which ignore global information (e.g. large blobs of moving pixels) in video inputs. This paper presents a novel extraction method which utilises global information from each video input so that moving parts such as a moving hand can be identified and are used to select relevant interest points for a condensed representation. The proposed method involves obtaining a small set of subspace images, which can synthesise frames in the video input from their corresponding coefficient vectors, and then detecting interest points from the subspaces and the coefficient vectors. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can yield a sparser set of interest points for motion recognition than existing methods.},

abstract = {How quickly do listeners recognize emotions from a speaker's voice, and does the time course for recognition vary by emotion type? To address these questions, we adapted the auditory gating paradigm to estimate how much vocal information is needed for listeners to categorize five basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, happiness) and neutral utterances produced by male and female speakers of English. Semantically-anomalous pseudo-utterances (e.g., The rivix jolled the silling) conveying each emotion were divided into seven gate intervals according to the number of syllables that listeners heard from sentence onset. Participants (n = 48) judged the emotional meaning of stimuli presented at each gate duration interval, in a successive, blocked presentation format. Analyses looked at how recognition of each emotion evolves as an utterance unfolds and estimated the "identification point" for each emotion. Results showed that anger, sadness, fear, and neutral expressions are recognized more accurately at short gate intervals than happiness, and particularly disgust; however, as speech unfolds, recognition of happiness improves significantly towards the end of the utterance (and fear is recognized more accurately than other emotions). When the gate associated with the emotion identification point of each stimulus was calculated, data indicated that fear (M = 517 ms), sadness (M = 576 ms), and neutral (M = 510 ms) expressions were identified from shorter acoustic events than the other emotions. These data reveal differences in the underlying time course for conscious recognition of basic emotions from vocal expressions, which should be accounted for in studies of emotional speech processing.},

abstract = {When explaining the failure of information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D) projects, researchers often turn to differences between how designers perceive and users experience the context of technology use. According to these explanations, ICT4D projects fail because designers take an uninformed stance toward context. The ICT4D literature offers four approaches for how designers might better design technology for the context of use. In all four approaches, the target of action is typically the technology itself, not the context. Despite increasing use of these four approaches, projects still fail because of persistent differences between designers{\textquoteright} perceptions and users{\textquoteright} experience. These differences appear inevitable because ICT4D projects address problems nested in complex systems whose interaction is difficult for designers to understand and predict. Yet, some projects do succeed. We show that success occurred in a Brazilian banking project because users took context-oriented, not technology-oriented, actions to better fit the technology with the context. Based on our case study, we develop propositions that integrate and expand existing theories of ICT4D project success.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new vector quantization method to create video thumbnail. In particular, we employ video time density function (VTDF) to explore the temporal characteristics of video data first. A VTDF-based temporal quantization is then applied to segment the whole video in time domain. The optimal number of segments is obtained by a temporal mean square error (TMSE)-based criterion. We employ independent component analysis (ICA) to each temporal segment for feature extraction and build a compact 2D feature space. An ICA mixture-based vector quantization method is developed to explore the spatial characteristics of video data. The optimal number of ICA mixture components is determined by Bayes information criterion (BIC). The video frames that are the nearest neighbors to the quantization codebook are sampled to generate the video thumbnails. Experimental results show that our method is computationally efficient and practically effective to create video thumbnails.},

abstract = {Recent work on natural categories suggests a framework for conceptualizing people's knowledge about emotions. Categories of natural objects or events, including emotions, are formed as a result of repeated experiences and become organized around prototypes (Rosch, 1978); the interrelated set of emotion categories becomes organized within an abstract-to-concrete hierarchy. At the basic level of the emotion hierarchy one finds the handful of concepts (love, joy, anger, sadness, fear, and perhaps, surprise) most useful for making everyday distinctions among emotions, and these overlap substantially with the examples mentioned most readily when people are asked to name emotions (Fehr {\&} Russell, 1984), with the emotions children learn to name first (Bretherton {\&} Beeghly, 1982), and with what theorists have called basic or primary emotions. This article reports two studies, one exploring the hierarchical organization of emotion concepts and one specifying the prototypes, or scripts, of five basic emotions, and it shows how the prototype approach might be used in the future to investigate the processing of information about emotional events, cross-cultural differences in emotion concepts, and the development of emotion knowledge.
